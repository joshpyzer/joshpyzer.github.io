Ok, so first of all I have an apology to make. When I first saw Marc's tweet about the 30 day writing challenge I had a quick skim of the title and assumed this was something Marc was taking on himself for a good cause or charity. So of course I scrolled down the bottom of his web page to pledge my full support! 

It was only when I received Marc's confirmation email that it suddenly dawned on me that I might have to do something! I had to take part in a 30 day writing challenge! I admit that at first I thought, nah, this isnâ€™t for me. But then I had a think about it and the things I could write about and thought, why the hell not! Even if no one reads them, its worth a shot.  

<h3>What are my targets?</h3>
Having not written a blog before my aim is to write 1 to 2 pieces a week. I have a number of posts in mind that should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Then hopefully some inspiration will guide me through the rest of the month 

<h3>My weapon of choice - Jekyll</h3>
So not only am I going out of my comfort zone to write a blog I thought I'd try something different with my blogging platform. I work with Wordpress every day. As much as I love Wordpress I wanted to try something new as I feel you can get too combatable working with the same platform all the time and this would be a good opportunity to try something new. 

I have gone down the route of using Jekyll through github pages. Github pages allows you to have one website hosted with them for free. It advices you to use Jekyll which you can easily install through the command line and the documentation is really good. 

The flat CMS takes away the hassle of having to set up a database and with it all running through the terminal and Git set up takes a mater of minuets. This set up is ideal for me as I can work on each post locally and when I'm happy I can push the new push live. 

I think the Jekyll set up is ideal for a developer that wants to block, however this work never work in a commercial environment. Imagine trying to train a client how to create posts and pages and then push it though Git. No thank you!

Overall I looking forward to this 30 day writing challenge and I hope it spurs me on to continue writing after the 30 days are over.
